# Dog Nightmares

Basically, the advice for every single episode of both Dog Whisperer and Kitchen Nightmares is the same. There's very little variation between episodes.

## Dogs

- Walk your dog
- Don't treat your dog like a person
- Your dog's not worried/afraid/upset, you are

## Restaurants

- Don't freeze your food
- Reduce the size of your menu
- Clean your kitchen

## The app

You answer a few questions about either your dog or restaurant, and the app will solve all your problems!

## Running locally

### for Android

- install Android studio
- set up a local emulator

```bash
npm start (to set up the metro server)

(in a separate terminal) npm run android
```

### for ios

(haven't got there yet...)
